I love to work, create and deploy architectures. I'm passionate about AWS Cloud Services, scripting and automation.

When I'm not working I like to play and take care of my dougher. Going  out to practice sports, stay with my kids, taste good food, wine and beer. I value to be able to connect with the nature and have valuable time off. Swimming, boxing, Rollerblade and running are some of the activates that a like practicing. I'm a very active person however I value piece and quite also having valuable time to myself and with my family.
